Here is a sonnet lacking in bouquet
For with a topic it is not endowed.
Like much that's written in the modern way
It's not a bit by lack of content cowed.
No matter how you study 'twixt its lines 
You won't a single dot of meaning find. 
What purpose has a fork deprived of tines?
A little more than this, if one is kind.
The ultimate in pointlessness is here:
An exercise in rhymed futility! 
I would not shed a single weary teare
Should its destruction come most speedily
And now that o'er these empty lines you've pored
I'll say this metasonnet leaves you bored.
